# SIGINT 101 — Learnings

The running ledger of surprising discoveries. Capture inline the moment you learn something
non-obvious (doc-flywheel skill: Capture → Promote → Clear). Dated section headers, newest
first; bold the finding, then the context.

## 2026-10-26: Harness installed

- **Feature-factory harness seeded (TDD + self-learning + self-documenting, solo footprint).**
  Hooks, pipeline/self-learning commands, and six skills are in place; this ledger is the
  self-learning substrate — append findings here, promote stable ones to the relevant doc.

## 2026-10-26: parallel workers sharing a schema need identical field names
**Finding.** Two parallel workers built against a shared "choices" contract from separate
briefs: the console's `lessons.py` parser required `{key,label}` and fails closed (refuses an
entry missing `key`), while the M1 pack was authored with `{label,value}`. Each branch's suite
passed alone; once both merged, M1 refused to load and its tests went red — a latent contract
conflict a clean textual merge does not catch.
**How to apply.** When fanning out parallel workers that share a data contract (a field name,
an enum, a file format), pin the exact names in every brief, and run the FULL suite on the
integration branch before landing, never only per-branch.
